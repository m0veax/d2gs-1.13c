# d2gs
Ubuntu Docker image of Diablo 2 Game Server v1.14d

Intended to use as a private Diablo 2 game server in combination with pvpgn. See https://pvpgn.pro/d2gs_installation.html for overview. 
Tested together with a docker image of pvpgn on the same server. See https://github.com/espenmjos/pvpgn

# Build 
Warning! Takes a long time to build (~30min for installing wine + download time of 1GB data + ~2min finalizing) and downloads over 1GB of data files. For continuous build testing please map needed Diablo 2 files from a local folder.  
Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/m0veax/d2gs-1.13c.git
```
Edit conf/d2gs.reg 
Set "D2CSIP" and "D2DBSIP" to server IP of docker host

Build the image: 
```
docker build -t d2gs:1.14d .
```

Run container:
```
docker run -d --name d2gs --net=host d2gs:1.14d
```
or
```
docker-compose up -d
```
I have only got this to work with host network. There are some address translation issues when using seperate docker network.

# Can it run on newer versions
I have tried ubuntu image 18.04 without any luck, but didn't use any time to figure it out. 
I also tried wine 5.0.2, but the sock.c change cannot be copied and used directly so I gave up.
